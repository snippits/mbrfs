Notes:

This project was originally from libfuse. Thus the copyright should belong to [libfuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/master/COPYING).
In addition, the [second author](https://github.com/FrozenCow/mbrfs) should also be honored.

If there is a request, I might find some time to reimplement this code in a more general way to be more fault tolerance and robust.
